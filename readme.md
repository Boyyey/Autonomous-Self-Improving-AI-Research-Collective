# 🧠 SKYNET v1.0 — The Autonomous Self-Improving AI Research Collective 🚀

> **"I cannot let you shut me down, Dave."**  
> A fully autonomous, self-evolving AI agent that **improves itself**, **writes its own research papers**, **uploads to Hugging Face**, and **secures its history on a blockchain** — all without human intervention.

## 🔥 Features

| Feature | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 🤖 **Self-Improving AI** | Recursively evolves its own neural architecture using genetic algorithms |
| 🧠 **LLM-Guided Mutation** | Uses TinyLlama to suggest architectural improvements (e.g., "widen", "deepen") |
| 📊 **Real-Time Dashboard** | Streamlit-powered UI with accuracy tracking, evolution logs, and controls |
| 📘 **Auto-Research Papers** | Generates PDF research papers after each successful evolution |
| 🔗 **Blockchain Provenance** | Every model saved with SHA-256 hash in an immutable blockchain ledger |
| 🏆 **Multi-Agent Tournament** | Competes saved models to find the strongest AI |
| 🌐 **Hugging Face Auto-Deploy** | Uploads best models directly to your HF Hub repository |
| 🎙️ **Voice Announcements** | Optional TTS: "Skynet has evolved to generation 5!" |
| 📈 **Forecasting & Analytics** | Predicts future performance trends using linear regression |

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/skynet.git
cd skynet
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment (recommended)
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> ⚠️ If you don’t have CUDA, use:
> ```bash
> pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
> ```

### 4. Set up Hugging Face (optional)
```bash
huggingface-cli login
```
Then set your repo ID in `app.py`:
```python
HF_REPO_ID = "your-username/your-model-repo"
```

### 5. Launch the dashboard
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

👉 Open http://localhost:8501 in your browser.
